# Alzheimer_Disease_Classification
ðŸš© This Project builts an end-to-end mutli-class classifier using various classifier Algorithms in Machine Learning.
The main aim of this project is to apply machine learning techniques on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset to classify the different stages of the Alzheimer Disease.

The five different classes namely 
* Cognitively Normal (CN),
* Early Mild Cognitive Impairment (EMCI) ,
* Late Mild Cognitive Impairment (LMCI),  
* Subjective Memory Complaint (SMC),
* Alzheimerâ€™s Disease (AD).

Machine Learning Models used:
* Random Forest Classifier
* Decision Tree
* Logistic Regression 
* Support Vector Classifier 
* Bagging 
* XGBoost 
* Stacking 
* Blending 

Conclusion: XGBoost can efficiently classify the stages of the Alzheimer Disease with an accuracy of 90% on the ADNI dataset.
